# Track_and_Trigger

Nowadays, due to hectic work schedules, it is quite difficult to remember as well as manage the availability of mandatory commodities in an urban home.
Thereby, we have put in efforts in developing an automated android application in order to keep track of the regular activities and aid people in managing the daily home inventories.
Android Requirements: minSDK Version 28, Target SDK Version 30
(Tested on Android-10)
